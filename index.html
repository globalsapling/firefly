            <h2>Welcome to Project Firefly</h2>
            <p>An ambitious open-source initiative dedicated to the development of a Small Molten Salt Fast Breeder Reactor (MSFBR). This project aims to revolutionize the nuclear energy sector by leveraging the principles of open-source collaboration to create a safer, more efficient, and sustainable nuclear reactor.</p>

            <h2>Breaking Tradition</h2>
            <p>The nuclear industry has historically been shrouded in secrecy and proprietary practices, often driven by the sensitive nature of nuclear technology and national security concerns. This closed-off approach has hindered collaboration, innovation, and rapid advancement in the field. However, the landscape is changing. Inspired by the success of open-source projects in other scientific domains, Project Firefly seeks to bring transparency and community-driven development to nuclear reactor technology.</p>
